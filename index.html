    <h2>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer and anti-colonial nationalist who employed non-violent resistance in the campaign for India's independence from British rule.</h2>
    
    <h2>Born in 1869 in Gujarat, India, Gandhi studied law at the Inner Temple in London.</h2>
    <p> After unsuccessfully attempting to practise in India, he moved to South Africa in 1893, where he stayed for 21 years. It was in South Africa that Gandhi first used tactics of non-violent resistance to campaign for civil rights. This activism gained Gandhi the title Mahatma, meaning ‘great soul’. 

        When Gandhi returned to India in 1915 he led campaigns to improve the lives of India’s peasants, farmers and labourers. He also popularised his concept of non-violent resistance, which became known in India as satyagraha, a Sanskrit and Hindi word meaning ‘holding onto truth’. It includes civil disobedience methods such as boycotts and strikes, but also the complete rejection of any form of violence, even in self-defence. Gandhi showed his support for India’s rural poor by rejecting Western dress for the traditional dhoti and living a simple and self-sufficient lifestyle. He also frequently practised fasting as a means of self-reflection and political protest. 

        Gandhi became involved in Indian politics in 1919 and aligned himself with the Indian National Congress. He became leader of the Congress in 1921, but chose to retire from the party in 1934 when his colleagues failed to fully embrace satyagraha. However, Gandhi remained committed to the fight for independence and was imprisoned from 1942 until 1944 for demanding British withdrawal from India.
        
        Although Gandhi welcomed Britain’s exit, he wanted to maintain a united India where the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh peoples could co-exist. Therefore when Partition happened in 1947, Gandhi did not participate in any official celebrations and instead visited areas that were greatly affected by the ensuing violence. 

        While many people supported Gandhi and his teachings, some Hindus believed that he was too supportive of Pakistan and Indian Muslims. Such views led militant Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse to assassinate Gandhi at an inter-faith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. Gandhi’s death was mourned across the nation, with over one million people joining his five-mile-long funeral procession. Today, his birthday is commemorated in India as a national holiday and worldwide as the International Day of Non-Violence.
